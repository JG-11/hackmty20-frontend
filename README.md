# HackMTY 2020

## Next.js web app

> This is a web app part of a microservices architecture. The backend repository can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/Geobm/HackMTY2020_Back-end">link</a>

The goal is to integrate an API which let GitHub users match mathematically their teams, and analyze a user profile using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

This project combines React Bootstrap, to improve UI and consistency across pages.

We hope you enjoy it!
