# HackMTY 2020

## Next.js web app

> This is a web app part of a microservices architecture. The backend repository can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/Geobm/HackMTY2020_Back-end">link</a>

The main goal is to integrate [GitHub API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to let users match mathematically their teams using [SequenceMatcher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) algorithm. By this way, deploying a percentage accuracy of matching for every user, and as a whole team as well. In addition, using Natural Language Toolkit [(NLTK)](https://www.nltk.org/) to analyze a GitHub profile showing a tag cloud image according to user's preferences.

This project combines React Bootstrap, to improve UI and consistency across pages.

We hope you enjoy it!

### Sincerely, Empty File
